## Why this Project?
Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development." This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to your local copy of index.html through your web browser

## Instructions
The required tests for the project (RSS Feed testing, RSS Feed properties, menu default state, and menu hiding/showing) are all provided and are comprehensive enough to adequately test the functionality.

Tests are independent of one another.

## Project Dependencies
- Udacity Feed Reader Project [Starter code](http://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader);
